 ##Intro

 PolyPie is a web application with the aim of visualize and understand polyrhythms and polymeters. In order to do that, a circular representation of beats is displayed. 

 Once you enter in the page, you will be able to set your polyrhthm or polymeter.

 ##Polyrhythm

A polyrhythm, or cross rhythm,   consists of layers of simpler rhythms. More than one type of rhythm is played at the same time, with each rhythm containing a different beat subdivision.

These subdivisions can be changed by typing values in guest rhythm and host rhythm. 

Host is the underlying pulse. It can be seen as the prevailing meter. Guest is the conflicting rhythm which occour within the duration of the main rhythm. Tatum is the shortest durational value which define the polyrhythm. It's the common multiple of guest and host.
